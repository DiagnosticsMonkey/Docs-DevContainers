# Overview

> [!TIP]
> The primary reason *we* started looking at Docker and DevContainers was to eliminate "It works on my machine" and conflicts between simultaneous projects...

We will be looking over the following ->

1. **Docker**
   1. What it is
   1. Why it exists
   1. How to set it up
1. **DevContainers**
   1. What they are
   1. Why they exist
   1. How to set them up
   1. Using them with VSCode

> [!NOTE]
> We will mostly be focussing on using Docker and DevContainers to *improve* development.
