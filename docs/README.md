# Introduction

DevContainers allow developers to standardise their development environment across machines, rather than relying on local installs which may have specific dependancies.

## Scope

This documentation will cover what Docker and DevContainers are at a high-level, how to set them up, and how to use them for development activities.

## Intended Audience

Dyson engineers affected by recent organisational changes, who now find themselves with free time and a desire to learn from each other.
